# Team28

Welcome to Team 28's CSCC01 Group project.

Our first deliverable can be found under the Reports directory in the root of the repository.

Our second deliverable along with our draft files can be found under the Product Backlog folder.

Once we have production-ready code, we will be merging it to the master branch, and we will update the README with how to navigate our project and code.

# UI Proof of Concept for JavaFX

Key idea: Stages (Overall window), Scenes (What is happening in the window), Nodes (The individual items in the Scene i.e. Text, buttons, etc.)
Rather than creating new stages, I have opted to create a new Scene for each new screen

There are two pages so far - a LoginPage and a MainPage (OptionOne,OptionTwo, etc. are new scenes but same content)
Login with "username", "password"
OptionsToolBar is a Horizontal box which will be constant between all scenes in the application (for user to switch what they are doing)
Buttons have event handlers added on to control what they do

Though I have kept it basic so far, can use CSS to design
