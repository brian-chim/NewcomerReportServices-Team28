# Team JavaBean (28)

Welcome to Team 28's CSCC01 Group project.

## Application
The source code for the Newcomer Report Services can be found within the NewcomerReportServices folder at the root of the project.

The project has been built using Maven and can be compiled through the command ```mvn compile``` and unit tested through ```mvn test``` from the NewcomerReportServices folder.

Currently, you can run the program through running the Main class in the java/ui/ folder from an IDE. (We have used Eclipse and IntelliJ)

### Application Folder Structure
The folder sqlite/db holds the central database used in the application.

Within the NewcomerReportServices/src/java/ folder, the application is further separated into two subfolders called application and ui for their respective usages. Within the application folder, you will find different packages for the database as well as user classes.

Unit tests can be found through the NewcomerReportServices/src/test/ folder.

## Deliverables

### Reports

All deliverable reports can be found within the Reports folder at the root of the project.

### Product Backlog

The product backlog contains versioned copies of the projects personas and user stories.
